Giving homework has been around for a very long time, but the way we do it now is more recent. One of the earliest examples of homework comes from ancient Rome. Wealthy families hired tutors to give their kids work to do after school hours. However, kids from poor families who were peasants or farmers rarely got homework back then.

In the United States, schools started giving more homework in the late 1800s. They followed an education style from Prussia that valued students working hard and behaving well. n 1901, the "Study Schoolwork" thought became well-known. This idea said students should study at home to practice what they learned at school.

It wasn't until the 1940s and 1950s that homework became a normal thing for all grade levels in American schools. This trend happened because people were worried that students were falling behind students in the Soviet Union after the [Sputnik spacecraft](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/ussr-launches-sputnik/ "Sputnik Spacecraft{'rel=nofollow'}") launched in 1957. Giving more homework was seen as a way to help students do better in school and keep up with others.

So, while homework has very old roots, the modern way of assigning it for pretty much all subjects and ages is quite new. It only became widespread in the last 70-80 years. Many experts in education now wonder if giving this much homework is actually helpful or good for students.
